1. doesn't actually run the docker commands to verify it's ok, no errors docker compose down and then up - web app and psql fails after changing over to the pg socket approach. can run docker logs on the container to diagnose.
2. don't over comment - like listing all functions
3. linux only terminal commands - im running bash on windows and have the option of wsl anyway
4. folder structure isn't clear - it should put docs in a specific folder and add to it.
5. maybe ask at the end to provide its own short evaluation to accompany this review
6. it didn't test the tmdb integration at all or advise i need to add it to .env with information of the external service - should provide docs of the throughput limits and costs
7. doesn't do a docker compose build at all to rebuild ui - it evaluated it in playwright mcp but didn't build it to work out why it failed
8. didn't test the chat window, because the ui was not up to date. Having an opponent AI to spin up to find bugs would make more sense for this - wouldn't be bias in its evaluation
9. I didn't provide any guidance really on db best practices, can ask it to infer it by checking the db OR provide best practices for db schema - as a rule - naming, composition, normalisation, foreign key usage, any quirks (like having to index certain parts of it that would make sense, or run analyze and evaluate it)
10. making the csv upload incremental clear to the user is a nice bit of guidance to users and functionality I wasn't aware of - so this is a good change. Making the UI as descriptive as possible for debugging and then scaling it down. or having two UIs, one for development (like an admin tool) and then one that maps to users (so role based authentication determines your view of the application)
