1. doesn't actually run the docker commands to verify it's ok, no errors docker compose down and then up - web app and psql fails after changing over to the pg socket approach. can run docker logs on the container to diagnose.
2. don't over comment - like listing all functions
3. linux only terminal commands - im running bash on windows and have the option of wsl anyway
4. folder structure isn't clear - it should put docs in a specific folder and add to it.
5. maybe ask at the end to provide its own short evaluation to accompany this review
6. it didn't test the tmdb integration at all or advise i need to add it to .env with information of the external service - should provide docs of the throughput limits and costs
