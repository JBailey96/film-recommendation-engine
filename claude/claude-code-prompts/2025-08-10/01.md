1. I want a way to save, clear and choose my chats from chat history. Have a save (floppy disk) icon to save the interaction which then moves it into a dropdown list at the top left of the chat window and I can then choose and resume it. Max 10 interactions which should be noted in the UI.
2. Evaluate whether it is an agentic flow or not - I think you we could implement a llama type flow for it. Assess it with the multiple function calls implemented at the moment and how LLM agentic flow libraries to facilitate that could improve the process. Produce a document on this for me to read and evaluate the options.
3. The timestamp on the chat response is white, it should be black for both user ask and response - as response especially has a white background
4. There are no posters at all in the movies layout - research what the best poster source is and implement it. If there's no public source then in the csv file imdb_rating.csv you have the url to the imdb file, so you could enrich the db so it can contain a link to the image when going onto the imdb website. You have access to playwright so can check this out. And if you need to scrape set up a playwright docker container in the docker compose and use it to scrape from the website.
5. i want a way to use pgsql cli to query the db, so create a script called psql in root project so i can connect via command line and run commands on it. You should also use it to analyse the data as well. Create a rule in a file in the project root to instruct yourself to use this again to connect to the db with a short guide on how to call it.
6. import data functionality does not work, it should be incremental and upload csv. Remove all references to scraping the url from imdb and specifying claude api key
7. docker should log out where each component - postgres, mcp server and the app are hosted
8. use pg socket in the docker config not specific ports, passwords. Seems very custom in terms of configuration.
9. Update the README for both mcp and docker
10. . It seems it's really poor practice to have to the claude api key in any of api endpoints. I don't like the flow to scrape imdb website. It doesn't go through the api now. it should go through the ui which should work as intended but it isn't. The import-csv process has to be on the website.
11. Test all of this by running docker, using playwright mcp, visiting http://localhost:8000/, verifying data is presented ok
12. Keep the changes using modern libraries with good practices, do not go overboard with further refactoring unless you think it is 
highly benificial to facilitating all the points mentioned. This applies to both the react front end and python backend, and all the dependencies in between.
13. Remember, You have access to the imdb ratings mcp server to query data as well.
14. Imdb rating data from imdb_rating.csv is already loaded in, can query for that
15. Produce a document of a short 5 point specific improvements that can be made to the application. The application is intended for data analysis on your imdb ratings and have a natural language conversation about it. A goal is eventually (not now) to have recommendations. Work out a plan of how this can be done without doing it and put it into this document in project root.
