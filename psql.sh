ðŸ“Š USEFUL DATABASE ANALYSIS QUERIES:

Basic Statistics:
  SELECT COUNT(*) as total_movies FROM movies;
  SELECT COUNT(*) as total_ratings FROM user_ratings;
  SELECT AVG(rating) as avg_rating FROM user_ratings;

Top Rated Movies:
  SELECT m.title, m.year, ur.rating, m.imdb_rating 
  FROM movies m 
  JOIN user_ratings ur ON m.id = ur.movie_id 
  ORDER BY ur.rating DESC, m.imdb_rating DESC 
  LIMIT 10;

Genre Analysis:
  SELECT genre, COUNT(*) as count 
  FROM movies, unnest(genres) as genre 
  GROUP BY genre 
  ORDER BY count DESC;

Rating Distribution:
  SELECT rating, COUNT(*) as count 
  FROM user_ratings 
  GROUP BY rating 
  ORDER BY rating;

Movies by Decade:
  SELECT (year/10)*10 as decade, COUNT(*) as count 
  FROM movies 
  WHERE year IS NOT NULL 
  GROUP BY decade 
  ORDER BY decade;

Director Analysis:
  SELECT director, COUNT(*) as movie_count, AVG(ur.rating) as avg_rating 
  FROM movies m 
  JOIN user_ratings ur ON m.id = ur.movie_id 
  WHERE director IS NOT NULL 
  GROUP BY director 
  HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3 
  ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;

Chat Conversation Stats:
  SELECT COUNT(*) as total_conversations FROM chat_conversations;
  SELECT COUNT(*) as total_messages FROM chat_messages;
  SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM chat_messages GROUP BY role;

Database Schema:
  \dt     -- List all tables
  \d movies  -- Describe movies table
  \d user_ratings  -- Describe user_ratings table
